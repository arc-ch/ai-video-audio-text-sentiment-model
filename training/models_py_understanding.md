# Comprehensive Deep Dive into Your Multimodal Sentiment & Emotion Model (`models.py`)

## Overview

This code builds a **multimodal neural network** designed to analyze videos by combining information from:

* **Text** (transcriptions or subtitles)
* **Video** (raw video frames)
* **Audio** (soundtrack features)

It aims to predict **both emotional categories** (7 classes) and **sentiment polarity** (3 classes: positive, neutral, negative).

The key challenge it tackles is **how to fuse diverse modalities with different characteristics and temporal scales** into a unified representation for joint emotion and sentiment classification.

## 1. Text Encoding with BERT (Frozen)

### Why BERT?

* BERT is a **pretrained transformer model** that captures rich linguistic context, essential for understanding nuanced emotions or sentiments in text.
* The `[CLS]` token embedding represents the whole sentence, making it a perfect semantic summary.

### Why freeze BERT?

* BERT is **large (110M+ params)** and requires substantial data and compute to fine-tune effectively.
* Freezing reduces the computational burden and avoids overfitting, assuming the pretrained embeddings are already meaningful enough.

### Implementation Details:

* Use `BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')`.
* Extract the `pooler_output` (the `[CLS]` token embedding).
* Project from 768 → 128 dims with a linear layer to reduce feature size and encourage compact representations.

```python
self.bert = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
for param in self.bert.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False  # Freeze BERT weights
self.projection = nn.Linear(768, 128)
```

**Insight:** Projecting into a lower dimension helps balance the feature scale when concatenating with other modalities and reduces overfitting risk on small datasets.

---

## 2. Video Encoding with 3D ResNet-18 (Frozen Backbone)

### Why 3D ResNet?

* Video is a sequence of frames, so a 3D CNN (convolution across space *and* time) captures spatiotemporal patterns.
* ResNet-18 is a relatively lightweight architecture, pretrained on large-scale video datasets (like Kinetics).

### Why freeze the backbone?

* Training a 3D CNN end-to-end is expensive and data-hungry.
* Freezing the backbone leverages pretrained spatiotemporal features and avoids overfitting on small datasets.

### Final layers are trainable to specialize to emotion/sentiment.

```python
self.backbone = vision_models.video.r3d_18(pretrained=True)
for param in self.backbone.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
num_features = self.backbone.fc.in_features
self.backbone.fc = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(num_features, 128),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.2)
)
```

**Insight:** This architecture encodes the **dynamic context** of the video — motion, facial expressions, body language — which are crucial cues for emotion.

---

## 3. Audio Encoding with 1D CNN (Frozen Conv Layers)

### Why 1D CNN on audio?

* Audio signals are 1D time-series data.
* Convolutions detect local frequency patterns or rhythms (pitch, tone, energy).

### Why freeze conv layers?

* Possibly pretrained conv layers capture robust acoustic features.
* Trainable projection layers adapt these features for the specific task.

```python
self.conv_layers = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv1d(64, 64, 3), BatchNorm1d(64), ReLU(),
    MaxPool1d(2),
    nn.Conv1d(64, 128, 3), BatchNorm1d(128), ReLU(),
    AdaptiveAvgPool1d(1)
)
for param in self.conv_layers.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

self.projection = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(128, 128),
    ReLU(),
    Dropout(0.2)
)
```

**Insight:** The frozen conv layers capture generic acoustic features (e.g., voice tone, prosody), and trainable layers tailor these for emotion/sentiment prediction.

---

## 4. Multimodal Fusion and Classification

### Why fuse modalities?

* Emotion/sentiment is a **complex interplay** between what is said (text), how it is said (audio tone), and what is seen (facial expression, gestures).
* Concatenation is a simple but effective fusion method, allowing the model to weigh modalities implicitly in downstream layers.

### Fusion process:

* Concatenate text, video, and audio features (each 128 dims → total 384 dims).
* Pass through fully connected layers to learn joint representations.
* Apply BatchNorm and Dropout to improve training stability and prevent overfitting.

### Separate classifiers:

* One head predicts **7 emotion classes**.
* Another predicts **3 sentiment classes**.

```python
combined = torch.cat([text_feats, video_feats, audio_feats], dim=1)
fused = self.fusion_layer(combined)

emotion_logits = self.emotion_classifier(fused)
sentiment_logits = self.sentiment_classifier(fused)
```

**Insight:** Separate heads enable the model to specialize for two related but distinct tasks, allowing shared feature learning but task-specific decision boundaries.

## 5. Handling Class Imbalance via Weighted Losses

### Problem:

* Real-world datasets often have skewed class distributions (e.g., fewer "surprise" emotions).
* Naively training leads to bias towards majority classes.

### Solution:

* Compute **inverse frequency weights** per class.
* Use **weighted cross-entropy** to penalize errors on minority classes more.

```python
emotion_weights = 1.0 / emotion_class_counts
sentiment_weights = 1.0 / sentiment_class_counts
```

**Why label smoothing?**

* Prevents overconfidence, improving generalization by softly penalizing wrong predictions.

---

## 6. Training Procedure and Optimization Strategy

### Optimizer:

* Adam optimizer with **differential learning rates**:

  * Very low LR for frozen modules (mostly zero update but small tweaks possible).
  * Higher LR for fusion and classification layers.

```python
optimizer = Adam([
    {'params': text_encoder.parameters(), 'lr': 8e-6},
    {'params': video_encoder.parameters(), 'lr': 8e-5},
    {'params': audio_encoder.parameters(), 'lr': 8e-5},
    {'params': fusion_layer.parameters(), 'lr': 5e-4},
    {'params': classifiers.parameters(), 'lr': 5e-4}
])
```

### Training loop:

* For each batch:

  * Forward pass through all encoders and fusion layers.
  * Compute loss (emotion + sentiment).
  * Backpropagation.
  * Gradient clipping to avoid exploding gradients.
  * Update parameters.

---

## 7. Evaluation Metrics and Logging

* Evaluate both **precision** and **accuracy** separately for emotion and sentiment.
* Use **weighted precision** to account for class imbalance.
* Use **TensorBoard** for real-time tracking of loss and metrics.

### Learning rate scheduler:

* Reduce LR on plateau to fine-tune as training converges.

---

## 8. Why This Design Works

* **Frozen pretrained encoders** reduce training time and need for large data.
* **Multi-headed outputs** tackle the two related tasks without interference.
* **Weighted losses** prevent bias towards common classes.
* **Multimodal fusion** captures complex emotion/sentiment cues.
* **Differential learning rates** optimize frozen and trainable parts differently.

---

# Final Notes and Potential Improvements

* Current fusion is simple concatenation; alternatives like attention or gated fusion could be explored.
* Temporal alignment between modalities is crucial—ensure inputs are synchronized.
* Consider fine-tuning some encoder layers on larger datasets if more data becomes available.
* Augmentation techniques in audio/video could improve robustness.

## 1. Tensor Shape Transformation Walkthrough

Assume the batch size = **B**

### Text Input (BERT)

* Input:

  * `input_ids`: `[B, seq_len]` (e.g., `[B, 50]`)
  * `attention_mask`: `[B, seq_len]`

* Pass through BERT (frozen)

  * Output `pooler_output`: `[B, 768]`
    (CLS token embedding representing the entire sequence)

* Projection Layer

  * Linear(768 → 128)
  * Output: `[B, 128]`

---

### Video Input (3D ResNet)

* Input raw video tensor: `[B, frames, channels, height, width]`
  e.g., `[B, 16, 3, 112, 112]`

* The model transposes frames and channels to `[B, channels, frames, height, width]`
  → `[B, 3, 16, 112, 112]`
  (This matches PyTorch video model input conventions)

* Pass through 3D ResNet backbone (frozen except final FC layer)

* Final FC layer outputs `[B, 128]`

---

### Audio Input (1D CNN)

* Input raw audio features: `[B, 1, 64, time_steps]` or `[B, 1, 64, L]`

* After squeezing channel dim: `[B, 64, L]`

* Conv1d layers + pooling reduce temporal dimension to 1 by adaptive avg pooling

* Output features shape after conv layers: `[B, 128, 1]`

* Squeeze last dim and pass through projection:
  Linear(128 → 128), ReLU, Dropout

* Final output: `[B, 128]`

---

### Fusion and Classification

* Concatenate text, video, audio features:
  `[B, 128] + [B, 128] + [B, 128] → [B, 384]`

* Fusion layer:
  Linear(384 → 256) + BatchNorm + ReLU + Dropout
  Output: `[B, 256]`

* Emotion classifier:
  Linear(256 → 64) + ReLU + Dropout + Linear(64 → 7)
  Output logits: `[B, 7]`

* Sentiment classifier:
  Linear(256 → 64) + ReLU + Dropout + Linear(64 → 3)
  Output logits: `[B, 3]`

        |----> Sentiment Classifier → logits [B, 3]
```

# How This Plays Out in Training

1. Dataset → batches of multimodal data.
2. Each batch goes through separate encoders, extracting modality-specific embeddings.
3. Features concatenated and fused to get joint embedding.
4. Classifiers produce emotion and sentiment predictions.
5. Loss computed against ground truth labels with class weights.
6. Backpropagation updates *only* trainable parts (fusion and classification heads mostly).
7. Metrics (accuracy, precision) tracked, learning rate adjusted on plateau.
