### Explanation:

# * **Purpose:**
#   This test function is designed to verify the logging mechanism in the `MultimodalTrainer` class, which typically logs losses and metrics during training and validation.

# * **How it works:**

#   * We create a minimal synthetic batch of data (`mock_batch`) with dummy tensors, wrapped inside a namedtuple to mimic the real batch structure the trainer expects.
#   * We use a `DataLoader` with this single batch to simulate the training and validation data loaders.
#   * We instantiate the model and trainer.
#   * We create example loss values for training (`train_losses`) and validation (`val_losses`) and metrics for validation (`val_metrics`).
#   * The `log_metrics()` method of the trainer is called for both training and validation phases. This method internally updates or writes logs (usually to TensorBoard or similar).

# * **Why:**
#   Testing logging independently like this helps confirm that the logging functionality does not raise errors and works as expected when given mock data and metrics â€” without needing to run a full training loop.

# * **Additional notes:**

#   * `torch.ones(1)` creates a tensor with shape `[1]` filled with ones, just placeholders.
#   * The `phase` parameter in `log_metrics()` specifies if we are logging for the training or validation stage.
#   * In a real scenario, the trainer would log these values to visualization tools like TensorBoard for monitoring training progress.
